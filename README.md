## Main functionalities
- Collect data within the provider domain
- The data are collected within Kubernetes Pods
- Can be configured through Kubernetes environment variables
- Collects metrics from operating system, Docker containers and processes created by the container
- Send the collected metrics to the ```collector``` module, which saves the data in a CSV file
- Can be controlled remotely by either a basic CLI or Python API

### Collected metrics

## Installation
Before installing Kubemon, make sure Kubernetes and Docker are properly installed in the system.

1. Download the latest version here: [kubemon v2.2.0](https://github.com/hrchlhck/kubemon/archive/refs/tags/v2.2.0.zip) 

2. Extract the zip file and go on the extracted directory

3. Update the ```nodeName``` field in ```kubernetes/04_collector.yaml``` to your the name of your Kubernetes control-plane node.

4. Apply the Kubernetes objects within ```kubernetes/```:
    ```sh
    $ kubectl apply -f kubernetes/
    namespace/kubemon created
    configmap/kubemon-env created
    persistentvolume/kubemon-volume created
    persistentvolumeclaim/kubemon-volume-claim created
    service/collector created
    service/monitor created
    pod/collector created
    daemonset.apps/kubemon-monitor created
    ```

The following subsection will detail about how to configure and execute the data collecting process.

## Configuration
Kubemon has a few variables that can be defined by the user. For instance, some of the required fields to be configured before running the tool is ```NUM_DAEMONS```, which denotes the expected amount of ```client``` instances should be connected to the ```collector``` component. In addition, the Kubemon components are configured through environment variables inside the Kubernetes pods.

The configuration file is at ```kubernetes/01_configmap.yaml```. At the current version of Kubemon, the configmap lists all the configurable variables. You can update according to your needs.

The collected metrics will be saved in the Kubernetes control-plane node by default, in ```/mnt/kubemon-data```. This setting can be changed in ```./kubernetes/02_volumes.yaml``` by updating the ```hostPath``` field. 

Example: 
```yaml
# Before
...
hostPath:
    path: "/mnt/kubemon-data"
    
# After
...
hostPath:
    path: "/home/user/data"
```

## Running
### Starting
To start the collecting process, you can either start the CLI or execute commands within Python. 

Example with the CLI:
```sh
$ make cli host=10.0.1.2
Waiting for collector to be alive
Collector is alive!
>>> start test000
Starting 2 daemons and saving data at 10.0.1.2:/home/kubemon/output/data/test000
```

Example by using the CLI API within Python:
```python
>>> from kubemon.collector import CollectorClient
>>> from kubemon.settings import CLI_PORT
>>> 
>>> cc = CollectorClient('10.0.1.2', CLI_PORT)
>>> cc.start('test000')
Starting 2 daemons and saving data at 10.0.1.2:/home/kubemon/output/data/test000
```

### Stopping

Within the CLI:
```sh
>>> stop
Stopped collector
```

Using the API:
```python
...
>>> cc.stop()
Stopped collector
```

### All the CLI commands:
You can retrieve all the implemented commands by either typing ```help``` within the CLI prompt or by running ```.help()``` method from the API.

All the commands:
```
'start': Start collecting metrics from all connected daemons in the collector.

    Args:
        - Directory name to be saving the data collected. Ex.: start test000
    
'instances': Lists all the connected monitor instances.
    
'daemons': Lists all the daemons (hosts) connected.
    
'stop': Stop all monitors if they're running.
    
'help': Lists all the available commands.
    
'alive': Tells if the collector is alive.
```
